Xurro was founded in 1996 by Ramon Covarrubias and his wife at Maxwell Street
Flea Market in Chicago. It all started with the mission to make the best
churros, after trying hundreds of recipes to make the perfect Churro, that soon
became the most popular in Chicago. Ramon started with a food truck that became
the most visited stand in the flea market. Customers were able to see and
experience the whole process of the product being made and fill with different
flavors. In January 2009 Carlos Covarrubias and his three sisters opened their
first storefront location in the Pilsen neighborhood. Today there’s eleven
location in the Midwest and in the beginning of 2019, Xurro opened two new
location in Orlando, Florida.
